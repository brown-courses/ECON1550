# ECON1550 International Finance - Spring 2026

Welcome to the course repository for ECON1550 International Finance at Brown University.

## Where to find course materials

Canvas is the official home for this course (announcements, assignments, grades, policies).

This GitHub repository provides two things:

1) The course website (GitHub Pages)
2) A small, allowlisted set of source files in the `main` branch

If you only need PDFs, the website is the simplest place to go.

## Links

- Gradescope: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1208698

## What is in each branch

- `main`:
  - Allowlisted sources only (e.g., `src/`, root `.qmd` files, repo metadata)
  - Does NOT include full LaTeX source trees or solution files
- `gh-pages`:
  - Published site output (HTML)
  - PDF files and source bundles live under `files/`
  - Per-file timestamps live at `files/file_timestamps.json`
