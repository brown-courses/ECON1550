<!-- ## Getting Started

### Is attendance required?

-->
### Will lectures be recorded?

No. Lectures are not recorded. If you miss class, get notes from a classmate and come to office hours with questions.

### Do I need the textbook version sold through Canvas or the Brown Bookstore?

No. You are welcome to use any edition or format of the textbook. The course does not rely on any proprietary or interactive features tied to a specific version.

### I earned what would have been an A while taking the course S/NC. Why don't I see S_DIST on my transcript?

As stated on the [Grade Options](https://college.brown.edu/design-your-education/explore-open-curriculum/course-selection/grade-options) page,

> "S with Distinction grades are not recorded on your Brown transcript or your internal academic record."

Therefore, even when the instructor enters S_DIST as your grade, you will still see "S."

The Registrar keeps a separate list of S_DIST awarded for internal academic uses such as honors eligibility. If you need confirmation, the Registrar can verify it for you.
