Come to class ready to take notes.\n\n\nIs attendance required?\nAttendance is not graded, but the material builds on itself quickly.

    "text": "Problem Sets\n\nWhen are problem sets due?\nProblem sets are due on Tuesdays at 11:59 PM ET. The exact due dates are on the schedule.\n\n\nWhere do I submit problem sets?\nSubmit on Gradescope. Make sure to match each problem with the correct pages when submitting.\n\n\nCan I work with other students?\nYes, collaboration is encouraged. Discuss problems with classmates and work through concepts together. However, you must write up your answers independently in your own words. Copying or paraphrasing another student’s work is not allowed.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension?\nExtensions are not granted for problem sets. Instead, your two lowest problem set scores are automatically dropped. This policy accommodates illness, travel, and other conflicts—use the drops wisely.\n\n\nHow are problem sets graded?\nEach problem is graded on a scale of 0–2:\n\n2: Correct answer with clear reasoning\n1: Meaningful progress or minor errors\n0: Missing, wrong approach, or no work shown\n\nShow your work. A correct numerical answer without supporting reasoning may not receive full credit."

Make-up exams require a Dean’s letter documenting the conflict or emergency. Anticipated conflicts (religious observances, varsity athletics) must be communicated before the exam.\n\n\nAre there sections during exam weeks?\nNo. Sections do not meet during midterm and final exam weeks. Review sessions will be scheduled instead—check Canvas for times."

Explain specifically why you believe the grading was incorrect. Note that your entire submission may be regraded, which could result in a higher or lower score.\n\n\nCan I take this course S/NC?\nYes. Brown’s standard S/NC policies apply. The S/NC deadline is set by the registrar. Deciding whether to take a course S/NC is a personal choice—think about your goals and workload."
